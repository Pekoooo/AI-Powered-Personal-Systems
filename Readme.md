## Architecture

- **Prompt Engineering**: Multi-trigger state management system
- **Database Integration**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) for Notion API
- **Cross-System Coordination**: Shared state management across AI assistants
- **Data Flow**: Real-time nutrition tracking → ASCII visualization → Notion logging
```

**2. Skills Demonstrated:**
- Prompt engineering (complex instruction sets, trigger systems)
- API integration design (Notion databases via MCP)
- State management across sessions
- Schema design for structured data
- AI-human collaboration patterns

**3. Real Metrics:**
Show the impact:
- "Automated tracking of 2800+ daily calories across 4 macros"
- "Cross-referenced nutrition database with 100+ logged foods"
- "Real-time visualization system with ASCII progress bars"
- "Multi-database coordination system with 7 connected Notion databases"
